# belajar-react-context

In this project i'm using react context as a library for managing and centralizing application state.
this project using [reqres API](https://reqres.in/) to serve registeration user. <br/>
In registeration page you must input the exact username and password to enter the users page.<br/>
username : eve.holt@reqres.in<br/>

2. users: where you can see token if your registeration is done
